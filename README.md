# JavaScript Platzi

This repository contains the materials for the JavaScript courses offered by Platzi, an online learning platform. The repository is organized into three folders, each containing materials for a different course:

- `Js-Basic-Course`: A course that teaches the basics of JavaScript, including syntax, data types, variables, functions, and control structures.
- `platzi-DOM-manipulation-course`: A course that focuses on the Document Object Model (DOM), a programming interface for web documents. Students will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS using JavaScript.
- `platzi-ECMAScript-course`: A course that covers ECMAScript, the standardized version of JavaScript. Students will learn about new features added to the language in recent years, such as arrow functions, classes, and modules.

## Getting Started

To get started with these courses, you'll need to create an account on [Platzi](https://platzi.com/), if you haven't already. The courses are offered in Spanish, so a basic understanding of the language is recommended.
